# The ggplot internals beastiary

--

😮 {ggplot2} is old (2005~), but the last & most important overhaul of the internals (ggproto) was pretty recent ([v2.0.0](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/ggplot2-2-0-0/), December 2015)

--

⚠️ Guides on ggplot internals are extremely sparse and scattered, and many are also outdated (but see [[1](https://github.com/paleolimbot/ggdebug)], [[2](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/ggbg/development/inst/doc/extensions.html)], [[3](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gginnards/vignettes/user-guide-1.html)], [[4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lemon/vignettes/gtable_show_lemonade.html)], [[5](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/gtable.html)])

--

❗ There are no smooth entry points for aspiring developers. Even for experienced users, the sheer scale and foreignness is demotivating.

--

❗❗ More over, you can't learn this through exposure, _by design_. This unintentionally creates a monopoly around the knowledge of how ggplot works under the hood.

--

🤔 Do we patiently wait, relying on the mercy and sacrifice of experienced developers to host webinars, release official guides, and hold our hands through this journey?

---

# What's so hard about learning it ourselves?

--

🤓 Many useRs are self-taught and learn through trial and error

--

In fact a lot of what happens in the building of a ggplot is actually just good ol' ✨data wrangling✨

--

# A different kind of accessibility problem

We want to interact with ggplot internals _from the outside_

--

But our familiar debugging tools fail us.

# Enter {ggtrace}!

--

**Goal: expose the internals of ggplot in the familiar _functional-programming_ sense, for learners and developers alike**

--

Here, we make some simplifying assumptions about ggplot internals:

--

The **input** - the _data_ being plotted & the _instructions_ for plotting it

  - The user-facing code `ggplot(data) + geom_*(...) + ...`

--

The **assembly line** - the _execution_ of plotting instructions on the data

  - Each layer's Stat/Geom/Position methods transform the data

--

The **output** - the data prepared for rendering _graphical primitives_

  - Between `ggplot_build()` and `ggplot_gtable()` at `print()`


---

# Our input

```{r, fig.height=4.5}
penguins_base <- ggplot(na.omit(palmerpenguins::penguins)) +
  aes(x = species, color = species) +
  theme_minimal()

my_plot <- penguins_base +
  geom_bar(size = 2)

my_plot
```

---

# Our target assembly line

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# ggplot2:::print.ggplot
function (x, newpage = is.null(vp), vp = NULL, ...) 
{
  set_last_plot(x)
  if (newpage) 
    grid.newpage()
  grDevices::recordGraphics(requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE), 
                            list(), getNamespace("ggplot2"))
  data <- ggplot_build(x)       #<<
  gtable <- ggplot_gtable(data)
  if (is.null(vp)) {
    grid.draw(gtable)
  }
  else {
    if (is.character(vp)) 
      seekViewport(vp)
    else pushViewport(vp)
    grid.draw(gtable)
    upViewport()
  }
  if (isTRUE(getOption("BrailleR.VI")) && rlang::is_installed("BrailleR")) {
    print(asNamespace("BrailleR")$VI(x))
  }
  invisible(x)
}
```

---

# Our output

```{r}
names(ggplot_build(my_plot))
ggplot_build(my_plot)$data[[1]]
```

--

```{r}
layer_data(my_plot, 1)
```

---

# Example: delayed aesthetic evaluation (1)

You can use `after_*()` functions to access computed variables

.pull-left[
```{r eval = FALSE}
penguins_plot1 <- penguins_base +
  geom_bar(size = 2) +
  aes(
    y = after_stat(count),
    fill = after_scale(alpha(color, .5))
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
penguins_plot1 <- penguins_base +
  geom_bar(size = 2) +
  aes(
    y = after_stat(count),
    fill = after_scale(alpha(color, .5))
  )
penguins_plot1
```
]

--

```{r}
layer_data(penguins_plot1)
```


---

# Example: delayed aesthetic evaluation (2)

How would you explain this behavior?

.pull-left[
```{r eval = FALSE}
penguins_plot2 <- penguins_base +
  geom_bar(
    size = 2,
    fill = "orange" #<<
  ) +
  aes(
    y = after_stat(count),
    fill = after_scale(alpha(color, .5))
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
penguins_plot2 <- penguins_base +
  geom_bar(
    size = 2,
    fill = "orange"
  ) +
  aes(
    y = after_stat(count),
    fill = after_scale(alpha(color, .5))
  )
penguins_plot2
```
]

```{r}
layer_data(penguins_plot2)
```

# Testing a hypothesis about the internals

**Does the `fill` aesthetic even get computed in `penguins_plot2`**?

This question cannot be answered just by looking at the transformed data from the `ggplot_build()` output - both answers are consistent

We need to track the data as it gets transformed _in the assembly line_

---

# Inspecting the assembly line

In a true know-nothing fashion, we're just going to log the data after every step that transforms it inside `ggplot_build()`

```{r}
data_assigning_steps <- c(8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26, 29, 30, 31)
as.character(ggbody(ggplot2:::ggplot_build.ggplot)[data_assigning_steps])
```

---

# Inspecting the assembly line

```{r, message=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
ggtrace(method = ggplot2:::ggplot_build.ggplot,
        trace_steps = data_assigning_steps + 1,
        trace_exprs = quote(data[[1]]),
        verbose = FALSE)
penguins_plot2
Filter(Negate(is.null), lapply(last_ggtrace(), `[[`, "fill"))
```

---

# Inspecting the assembly line (again)

Are we really sure that the `fill` aesthetic simply doesn't get calculated when it's supplied as a constant?

Let's jump into the first robot arm that computes `fill`, and see whether it was ever calculated internally

```{r}
data_assigning_steps[which(sapply(last_ggtrace(), function(x) {"fill" %in% colnames(x)}))]
ggbody(ggplot2:::ggplot_build.ggplot)[[29]]
```

```{r}
as.character(ggbody(ggplot2:::Layer$compute_geom_2))
```

---

# Inspecting the assembly line (again)

```{r, error = TRUE}
class(geom_bar()$geom)
ggbody(GeomBar$use_defauts)
invisible(capture.output(ggbody(GeomBar$use_defaults, inherit = TRUE)))
```

Again in a true know-nothing fashion, we log the value of `data` at every step

```{r message = FALSE, fig.show = 'hide'}
ggtrace(method = Geom$use_defaults,
        trace_steps = seq_along(ggbody(Geom$use_defaults)),
        trace_exprs = quote(data),
        verbose = FALSE)
penguins_plot2
```

---

# Inspecting the assembly line (again)

Looks like we were wrong! Step 7 of `Geom$use_defaults` calculates the `fill` aesthetic according to `after_scale()`

```{r}
Filter(Negate(is.null), lapply(last_ggtrace(), `[[`, "fill"))
which(sapply(last_ggtrace(), function(x) {"fill" %in% colnames(x)}))
```

---

# Yay!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/after_scale-resolved.png", error = FALSE)
```
